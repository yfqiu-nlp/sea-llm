Ruth developed an early interest in politics and joined the Social Democratic Workers' Party of Austria (SDAP\u00d6) in her teens.\n\nDuring World War I, Ruth became increasingly radicalized and, in 1918, she co-founded the Austrian Communist Party (KP\u00d6) alongside her brother Gerhart Eisler. In 1920, she moved to Germany and joined the Communist Party of Germany (KPD), where she quickly rose through the ranks, becoming a prominent figure in the party's left-wing faction.\n\nIn 1925, Fischer was elected as the chairperson of the KPD, making her the first woman to lead a major political party in Germany. During her tenure, she advocated for a strong, centralized party and sought to forge alliances with other left-wing groups, including the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD).\n\nHowever, her leadership was met with internal opposition, and in 1926, she was ousted from the KPD's central committee following a power struggle. She was expelled from the party in 1927 and subsequently turned against the Soviet Union and the Comintern, accusing them of betraying the working class.\n\nAfter leaving the KPD, Fischer continued to write and speak against Stalinism, eventually moving to France and later to the United States. In 1948, she testified before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), providing information about Soviet espionage and her former comrades in the KPD.\n\nIn her later years, Fischer focused on writing and research, authoring several books on the history of communism and her experiences within the movement. She died in Paris on March 13, 1961, at the age of 65. Despite her controversial and tumultuous political career, Ruth Fischer remains an important figure in the history of European communism and the struggle for workers' rights.", "topic": "Ruth Fischer", "cat": ["rare", "Europe/Middle East"]}

Born in \u00c1lamos, Sonora, he began his military career at a young age and participated in various campaigns, eventually rising through the ranks.\n\nZuloaga's political inclinations leaned towards conservatism, and he became an ardent supporter of the Conservative Party in Mexico. In December 1857, amidst the escalating conflict between liberals and conservatives, Zuloaga issued the Plan of Tacubaya, a manifesto that called for the nullification of the liberal Constitution of 1857 and the establishment of a provisional government. This would eventually lead to the Reform War (1857-1861), a civil war fought between the Liberal and Conservative factions.\n\nDuring the Reform War, Zuloaga was named President of Mexico by the conservatives on three separate occasions (1858, 1859, and 1872), though his terms were marked by instability and strife. His presidencies were not universally recognized, as the liberals considered Benito Ju\u00e1rez to be the legitimate president. The conflict eventually ended with a liberal victory, and Ju\u00e1rez emerged as the uncontested leader of Mexico.\n\nFollowing the Reform War, Zuloaga went into exile in Europe and later returned to Mexico after the fall of Emperor Maximilian I during the French Intervention (1862-1867). He was granted amnesty by President Ju\u00e1rez and retired from political life.\n\nF\u00e9lix Mar\u00eda Zuloaga died on February 11, 1898, in Mexico City. His legacy remains a complex one, reflecting the broader struggle between liberal and conservative forces that shaped Mexico's political landscape during the 19th century.", "topic": "F\u00e9lix Mar\u00eda Zuloaga", "cat": ["rare", "Latin America/Africa"]}

Throughout the wars, James served under King Edward IV and later his brother, King Richard III.\n\nTyrrell's military career included fighting in the Battle of Tewkesbury in 1471, where the Yorkists won a decisive victory. In 1475, he was knighted for his services to the crown. Later, he served as High Sheriff of Cornwall from 1480 to 1483, and he was appointed as the Constable of the Tower of London in 1483.\n\nJames Tyrrell's name became infamous due to his alleged role in the deaths of the Princes in the Tower. In 1483, King Edward IV died, and his son, the 12-year-old Edward V, was supposed to succeed him. However, Edward V and his younger brother Richard were declared illegitimate by their uncle, Richard III, who then became king. The two young princes were placed in the Tower of London, where they later disappeared.\n\nIn 1502, during the reign of King Henry VII, James Tyrrell was arrested for supporting another Yorkist claimant, Edmund de la Pole.

There is still debate among historians about the veracity of this confession and the actual fate of the princes.\n\nJames Tyrrell was executed for treason on May 6, 1502.

The LRA is known for its brutality and has been responsible for numerous human rights violations, including the abduction of children to serve as soldiers and sex slaves, as well as the killing and mutilation of civilians.\n\nDuring its peak, the LRA operated primarily in northern Uganda, as well as parts of South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the Central African Republic. In response to the LRA's atrocities, the International Criminal Court (ICC) issued an arrest warrant for Kony in 2005, charging him with war crimes and crimes against humanity.\n\nKony gained international notoriety in 2012 with the release of the documentary \"Kony 2012\" by the nonprofit organization Invisible Children. The film aimed to raise awareness of Kony's crimes and called for his capture and prosecution. While the campaign succeeded in increasing global awareness of Kony and the LRA, it also faced criticism for oversimplifying the conflict and its portrayal of the situation in Uganda.\n\nIn recent years, the LRA has been significantly weakened due to military pressure from regional governments and the United States.

He was born on August 10, 1782, in the small village of Tixtla, located in the modern-day state of Guerrero, Mexico. He was of mixed African, Indigenous, and Spanish heritage, which later became an important aspect of his political identity.\n\nGuerrero began his career as a mule driver but was gradually drawn into the fight for Mexican independence. In 1810, he joined the insurgency led by Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Morelos, a Catholic priest who was one of the early leaders of the independence movement. Guerrero quickly rose through the ranks, demonstrating excellent military skills and a strong commitment to the cause.\n\nAfter Morelos' capture and execution in 1815, Guerrero continued to lead the fight against Spanish colonial rule. He formed alliances with other insurgent leaders, including Guadalupe Victoria and Nicol\u00e1s Bravo, and employed guerrilla tactics to resist the Spanish forces effectively. In 1821, Guerrero joined forces with Agust\u00edn de Iturbide, a former Royalist officer who had switched sides in support of Mexican independence. Together, they signed the Plan of Iguala, which laid out the terms for Mexico's independence from Spain.\n\nFollowing the successful conclusion of the war, Guerrero was a key figure in the formation of the new Mexican government. However, he soon found himself at odds with Iturbide, who declared himself Emperor of Mexico. Guerrero opposed this move and, along with other leaders such as Antonio L\u00f3pez de Santa Anna and Guadalupe Victoria, helped create the Plan of Casa Mata, which eventually led to Iturbide's abdication in 1823.\n\nIn 1824, the Mexican Republic was established, and Guerrero played a significant role in drafting the country's new constitution. He was elected as Mexico's second president in 1829, after a tumultuous period of political instability. Guerrero's presidency focused on social reforms, including the abolition of slavery and advocating for the rights of Indigenous peoples and other marginalized groups.\n\nUnfortunately, Guerrero's time in office was short-lived. He faced opposition from conservative factions within the government and military, which led to his eventual overthrow in a coup led by his former ally, General Nicol\u00e1s Bravo. Guerrero was captured and executed on February 14, 1831.\n\nDespite his brief presidency, Vicente Guerrero is remembered as a champion of social justice and a key figure in the struggle for Mexican independence.

He is best known for serving as the third Vice President of the United States under President Thomas Jefferson from 1801 to 1805 and for his infamous duel with Alexander Hamilton in 1804.\n\nBorn in Newark, New Jersey, Burr was the son of a Presbyterian minister and a grandson of theologian Jonathan Edwards. He studied theology at the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) but later switched to law. He began his legal career in 1782 after serving as an officer during the American Revolutionary War. Burr became a prominent lawyer in New York City and was elected to the New York State Assembly in 1784.\n\nIn 1791, Burr was elected to the United States Senate, where he served until 1797. He then ran for Vice President in the 1796 election but failed to secure the position. In 1800, he ran again, this time alongside Thomas Jefferson on the Democratic-Republican ticket. The election resulted in a tie between Jefferson and Burr, which was resolved by the House of Representatives in favor of Jefferson, making Burr the Vice President.\n\nAaron Burr's tenure as Vice President was tumultuous, as he faced opposition from both Federalists and his own Democratic-Republican Party. His most notorious action during this time was engaging in a duel with Alexander Hamilton, former Secretary of the Treasury and a leading Federalist, on July 11, 1804. Hamilton was mortally wounded in the duel and died the following day, which tarnished Burr's reputation and led to his political downfall.\n\nAfter his term as Vice President ended, Burr ventured westward and became involved in a mysterious plot, known as the Burr Conspiracy. The exact details of the plot are still debated by historians, but it involved plans to create an independent country in the western territories or possibly to invade Spanish-held Mexico. In 1807, Burr was arrested and tried for treason, but he was acquitted due to lack of evidence.\n\nFollowing his acquittal, Burr lived in Europe for several years before returning to the United States in 1812. He resumed his law practice in New York City and lived a relatively quiet life until his death in 1836 at the age of 80.

{"input": "Question: Tell me a bio of Cleopatra.", "output": "Cleopatra VII Philopator (69 BCE \u2013 30 BCE) was the last active Pharaoh of Ancient Egypt, belonging to the Ptolemaic dynasty. Born in Alexandria, she was the daughter of Pharaoh Ptolemy XII Auletes and Cleopatra V Tryphaena. Cleopatra is well-known for her exceptional intelligence, wit, and beauty, as well as her romantic relationships with two powerful Roman generals, Julius Caesar and Mark Antony.\n\nCleopatra ascended to the throne at the age of 18, following her father's death in 51 BCE. Initially, she co-ruled with her younger brother Ptolemy XIII, who was also her husband due to dynastic customs. However, sibling rivalry and political tensions led to a civil war between the two. In 48 BCE, Julius Caesar arrived in Egypt, and Cleopatra saw an opportunity to solidify her position. She formed a romantic and political alliance with Caesar, leading to her brother's defeat and death in the Battle of the Nile in 47 BCE.\n\nCleopatra then became the sole ruler of Egypt and had a son with Caesar, named Caesarion. After Caesar's assassination in 44 BCE, Cleopatra formed another alliance, this time with Mark Antony, one of Caesar's supporters and a member of the Second Triumvirate. They had three children together and aimed to consolidate their power in the Eastern Mediterranean.\n\nThe relationship between Cleopatra and Mark Antony alarmed Rome, and tensions eventually escalated into a military conflict, with Octavian (later known as Emperor Augustus) leading the Roman forces against them. In the Battle of Actium in 31 BCE, Octavian's fleet defeated the combined forces of Cleopatra and Antony, prompting them to retreat to Egypt.\n\nIn 30 BCE, as Octavian's forces closed in on Alexandria, Mark Antony committed suicide, believing that Cleopatra had already done so. Cleopatra, however, was still alive, and after realizing that she had no chance of negotiating with Octavian, she chose to end her life as well. The details of her death remain uncertain, but it is widely believed that she committed suicide by allowing a poisonous snake, an asp, to bite her.\n\nCleopatra's death marked the end of the Ptolemaic dynasty and the Hellenistic period, as Egypt became a province of the Roman Empire. Her life has been the subject of numerous works of art, literature, and film, making her one of the most enduring and intriguing figures of ancient history.", "topic": "Cleopatra", "cat": ["very freq", "Latin America/Africa"]}
